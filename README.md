# Technical-Analysis-Backtest

This repo is part of an ongoing project to develop tools for building trend-following trading systems (or 'swing' trading) based on technical analysis. For quick screening of a trading strategy, strategy_backtester.ipynb can be used. Inputs that can be customised are: bid-ask spread, fees, ticker symbol, start and end dates, choice of technical analysis indicators, as well as the entry and exit rules. Examples of the earlier strategies can also be found within early_version directory.

**Disclaimer:**
The files and codes here are presented for *educational purposes only*. Please do your own due diligence & trade at your own discretion. The codes can be used a starting point to develop more advanced backtesting strategies, but please don't use them in their current form to execute real trades in the financial markets using your own hard-earned cash (or, worse, someone else's cash). Fees, spread, and slippage have not been accounted for in the models.
