# Technical-Analysis-Backtest

This repo is part of an ongoing project to develop tools for trend-following trading systems (or 'swing' trading) based purely on technical analysis. Examples of the strategies can be found and more will be developed in the future.

**Disclaimer:**
The files and codes here are presented for *educational purposes only*. Please do your own due diligence & trade at your own discretion. The codes can be used a starting point to develop more advanced backtesting strategies, but please don't use them in their current form to execute real trades in the financial markets using your own hard-earned cash (or, worse, someone else's cash). Fees, spread, and slippage have not been accounted for in the models.
