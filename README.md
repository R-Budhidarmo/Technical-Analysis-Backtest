# Technical-Analysis-Backtest

This repo is part of an ongoing project to develop tools for building trend-following trading systems based on technical analysis. For a quick screening of a trading strategy, the [strategy_backtester.ipynb](https://github.com/R-Budhidarmo/Technical-Analysis-Backtest/blob/main/strategy_backtester.ipynb) can be used. Inputs that can be customised are: bid-ask spread, fees, ticker symbol, start and end dates, choice of technical analysis indicators, as well as the entry and exit rules.

Once a potentially viable strategy has been found using the code above, the [multistock_backtester.ipynb](https://github.com/R-Budhidarmo/Technical-Analysis-Backtest/blob/main/multistock_backtester.ipynb) can be used to screen the strategy against a universe of securities. In this example, the top 50 stocks from [S&P500](https://github.com/R-Budhidarmo/Technical-Analysis-Backtest/blob/main/stocks_universe.csv) were screened. Equity curves generated by the multistock backtester are stored in the [stocks_equity_curve](https://github.com/R-Budhidarmo/Technical-Analysis-Backtest/tree/main/stocks_equity_curve) directory.

Examples of defunct archived strategy testers can also be found within [early_version](https://github.com/R-Budhidarmo/Technical-Analysis-Backtest/tree/main/early_version) directory.

**Disclaimer:**
The files and codes here are presented for *educational purposes only*. Please do your own due diligence & trade at your own discretion. The codes can be used a starting point to develop more advanced backtesting strategies, but please don't use them in their current form to execute real trades in the financial markets using your own hard-earned cash (or, worse, someone else's cash). Slippage has not been accounted for in the codes.
